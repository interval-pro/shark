# Shark Project

Welcome to the Shark Project!

This is an innovative web application designed to provide a hands-on, interactive experience with SHA-256 hashing. It allows users to visually explore and understand the process of SHA-256 hashing by inputting data and observing the step-by-step transformation into a hash. This project is particularly useful for educational purposes, helping those new to cryptography grasp the complexities of hashing algorithms in a more intuitive way. Additionally, it serves as a practical tool for anyone interested in the mechanics of hash generation and cryptographic security.
